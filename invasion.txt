Invasion
Psycatic Software
2013
Space Invaders

Has 6 different game modes. Also available on Sega CD.

"Invasion" is a playable history of space invader type games. It's not a direct recreation of any 
particular version of space invaders but instead a collection games and artwork to inspire nostalgia. 
For the main release it has 6 different game modes plus a two player mode, the free version available 
below has just three game modes.

The project started as a test, to check that the old Psygnosis Megadrive Development Kit I had was 
working and to see if I had everything I needed in terms of a tool chain to build a fairly complete 
game. I wanted to ensure I had the tools to be able to create graphics and sound for the SEGA 16-bit 
platform and also a set of development libraries and programming techniques. The platform is not like 
programming a PC or a modern console and special consideration has to be given to the limited hardware 
and design choices that SEGA put together.
