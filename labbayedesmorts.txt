L'ABBAYE DES MORTS (MEGADRIVE/GENESIS) (POR 002)

Megadrive port of the game created  by Locomalito and Gryzor in 2010, it is an icon of the homebrew development. 
It brought back the mechanics of the videoadventures so classic in the 80’s microcomputers. 
A demanding game where you will have to control Jean Reymond, a  Cathar monk , to escape to a fatal fate at the 
hands of the Crusade knights who want to hunt him. It was originally released for PC and then ported to a 
multitude of systems. Tour the author's website for more information: http://www.locomalito.com
