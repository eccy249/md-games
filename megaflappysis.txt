Mega Flappy Sis

The first ever game by Beetroot games.

Update January 2018:
     2 player moder
     hardcore mode
     some bugfixes (most only show on real hardware) 


This game was developed for the Sega Mega Drive or Sega Genisis (US).
You will need an emulator to run it on modern systems.
Simply search the net for "sega genisis emulator".


Based on the original Flappy Bird by Dong Nguyen (2013)
The objective was to direct a flying bird, named "Faby", who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. 
If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; 
if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player 
a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
