This is my first fullgame on basiegaxorz. Port Yie Ar Kung-Fu - NES game.
Used Music Engine by Shiru.

Gameplay
Yie Ar Kung-Fu (Chinese: 一二功夫; pinyin: yī èr gōngfū; literally: "One Two Kung Fu") 
features the protagonist who is a Wong Jack Man-based Kung Fu master named Oolong 
(Chinese: 烏龍; pinyin: Wūlóng, Japanese: ウーロン Ūron; see oolong) (renamed Lee for 
the MSX and Famicom ports), controlled by the player. Oolong must fight all the 
martial arts masters given by the game (11 in the arcade version; five to 13 in 
the home ports) to win the title of "Grand Master" and honor the memory of his 
father. On his side is a variety of punch and kick blows reachable by combining 
the joystick with one of the buttons (punch or kick). He also has the greatest 
jumping ability of all the game's fighters, with the exception of "Blues".

The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and fighting style.
The player can perform up to 16 different moves,[6] using a combination of buttons and 
joystick movements while standing, crouching or jumping.[7] Moves are thrown at high, 
middle, and low levels. Regardless of the move that defeated them, male characters 
(save Feedle) always fall unconscious lying on their backs with their legs apart 
(players flail their feet), and female characters always fall lying on their sides. 
Feedle disappears. When a player gains an extra life, the word "xiè xiè" 
(Mandarin for "thank you") is heard.
