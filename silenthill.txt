Genesis is an freeware fan-made adaptation of the original Silent Hill for Sega Megadrive/Genesis 
in the form of visual novel, based on Silent Hill: Play novel for GBA.
A visual novel is an interactive fiction game featuring mostly static graphics with text. 
At certain moments the game asks a player to make a choice between two or more possible variants 
which affect the following walkthrough.
Such kind of games is very popular in Japan, however totally unpopular in the west, therefore 
Silent Hill: Play Novel was never released outside this country.

The game offered two scenarios: for Harry and Cybil (available after completing Harry's Scenario). 
Besides the narration the game features a couple of puzzles and multiple endings.
After reaching the end of Cybil scenario a player is awarded with Digital Cards - 32 in total.
