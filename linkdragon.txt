LINK DRAGON
1993
Songtly and Jumbo Team

LINK DRAGON is an unlicensed Blockade clone for the Sega Mega Drive by the Taiwanese companies Songtly and Jumbo Team released in 1993. 
The game is divided into several levels; after collecting a certain amount of fire a door opens (which you must go to without dying). 
Dying starts you at the beginning of the stage. A great game that deserves to be in any collection!
