Iron Man
BMB
2014


Iron Man is an unlicensed 2D platform game for the Sega Mega Drive based off the Marvel character of the same name. 
It was released by BMB in 2014. The music is glitched when running on a real Mega Drive (Or Genesis), although 
it is fixed when running on a MD/Genesis Emulator. The same glitch occurs in LEGO Batman and The Adventures 
of the Gummi Bears, which could imply that all three share an engine and were possibly made by the same developers. 
It plays very similar to the aforementioned Adventures of Gummi Bears, like a platformer with no scrolling implemented.
