Funny World & Balloon Boy

Funny World & Balloon Boy is an unlicensed Sega Mega Drive cartridge by Realtec released in the United States.

This is the only Realtec game which makes use of the mapper functionality of their special mapper; each game 
occupies one mapper bank. All other Realtec games (as well as this one) would otherwise use the mapper for copy protection. 


It contains two games by AV artisan, selectable by a menu on boot:

Funny World: Shooting gallery game. Left and Right move the gun and B shoots. 
             There are some targets to avoid (such as humans).

Balloon Boy: Some type of shooting/dodging game. Left and Right move around, 
             A shoots (you can only shoot straight up), and B jumps. 
             The goal of each level is to shoot at balloons, collecting goodies 
             that come out of some of them but avoiding traps that come out of some others.
