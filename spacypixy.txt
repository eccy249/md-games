Project description:
I just found this compo only recently. Even there wasn't much time to work, I really wanted to try. 
You see--I love RETRO CONSOLE!! So, when I heard it is RETRO-theme compo, I just had to enter  

This is my first time to write a code on this hardware (mega-drive). 
I thought it's important to me, so I had to make retro console (not nds or psp or iphone etc) game

So... then some couple short weeks of learning, learning learning,  ~sm-58.gif~.gif and, little bit of work  
I made this entry for 2010 summer Neo Compo! I tell honest, it is not perfect for my standard... almost, 
I didn't enter it!! But, then, I see so many NDS, PSP game here... and no love for mega-drive  :'( 
(or even nes/gba/gbc,,why???) so even it's not my best work, I'll share anyway  ::sm-25.gif:: retro console never let die!!! hehehe

ps- sorry my poor english...i got little help so game is not so bad english...maybe i made some mistake, i hope you please excuse~

How to use it:
i can make it much more difficult, but i hoped you can all finish this game ^^ the story is quite fun to me~ so, maybe it little 
too easy, but was my intention in this version of game.
it's very simple game... you just gotta, collect mushrooms. when mushroom counter = 0, you can collect a horn. when horn counter = 0, 
you can finish the level (use a wand the rainbow bridge)

Controls:
d-pad = move the pixy
A button = use the wand
^--use wand on: the mushroom, unicorns' horn, rainbow briges, boss (<3)

This game is 8 level, and you can choose the start level. I made it so you can see all level, even if you hate the play...  
::sm-02::  maybe you can enjoy storyline,
but you gotta beat the BOSS if u wanna see ending and credits  ~sm-31.gif~
