Originally, Flappy Bird appeared on mobile devices running Android and iOS . 
Despite its simple gameplay, the game got a lot of fans. 
And it was ported to many different systems and game consoles. 
But before all the favorite 16-bit game console Sega MegaDrive / Genesis and did not get there. 
We saw only a lot of promises and attempts to make the FB port for SMD , but they all failed. 
Team PSCD.ru decided to correct this injustice and make the game Flappy Bird for SMD in June 2014. 
On the account of a professional development team there is also a port of the game MineSweeper 
( Sapper ) from under OS Windows on Sega Mega Drive . Port of the game Flippy Bird for Sega Mega 
Drive was as accurate as possible. Completely transferred to the whole gameplay of the game. 
Management in the game is done with just one button, which forces the bird to gain altitude. 
Your main goal is to fly between the pipes sticking from below and from above, trying to fly 
them as much as possible, in order to establish another record.
