Mega Q*bert
Released By	Jaklub
Release Date	08 June 2016

Description:
Almost 6 years ago, a prototype of a game called “Mega Q*bert” was started, 
but was never finished due to a massive amount of problems with the game’s 
structure. It was later rewritten from scratch and it’s now done.

Mega Q*bert is a fan adaptation of the popular arcade title for the Sega 
Mega Drive/Genesis. The title has 2 modes - Mega mode with 80 new different 
levels to beat and an Arcade mode, which is based on NES Q*bert 
(which in turn is based on the original game). Both modes allow simultaneous 
cooperative play.

The game unfortunately hasn’t been tested on the actual hardware.
