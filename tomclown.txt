Tom Clown [Circus 2600]

Tom Clown is an unlicensed game for the Sega Mega Drive developed by AV artisan and published by Realtec in 1993.

The game is a re-imagining of the Atari 2600 game Circus — move the teeterboard back and forth to bounce the clowns 
upwards and pop balloons. Power-ups will pass by overhead and give the player extra chances or clear certain colored 
balloons. After clearing the stage, the player moves onto the next round.
