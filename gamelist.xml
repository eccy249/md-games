And at each turn the player needs to choose one of two options, where to turn the steering wheel relative to the driver: to the right or to the left. The game is complicated by the fact that the player needs to mentally represent the position of the car and at what turn it is now. After passing several turns the car reaches the finish line, after which it moves to the next more difficult level. From level to level, only the number of turns is added; changes route.</desc>

The observatory space station and surface of the planet were being devoured by a swarm of space insects. Using bits granted to the by the phantom bird of planet Toal, the metal hawks wiped out the invaders. Ruby and Cobalt then perched on to a mountain top and turned to stone. Hundreds of orbits of the planet have passed. The space insects have returned with a  device called the Buzzstar. It has the power to burn the atmosphere off of a planet. The old observatory space station is already infested, and the Buzzstar is close. Ruby and Cobalt return to their original form and fly off to meet the invaders once again. Can the metal hawks conquer 7 stages with wave after wave of invaders and giant screen filling bosses?</desc>

Sausage, the Origins : The wacky Willy Weiner (his real name) has to please the mighty king of all seas - the sea lion seen in the jam keynote video who waves his flipper at the end - by surfing a crowded wave and collecting cool items. The rhythm part comes from the layout of these elements. The more you get the better the background music improves. Additionally some digitized sample of a TV documentary on the true "Strasbourg's sausage" is played while collecting the items. Carefully though ! You have to avoid sharks who love the sausages.</desc>

Mines can be blown up when passing by or disarmed by Xump when staying on this specific field for a short moment. Certainly the mission sounds easier than it will be.</desc>
