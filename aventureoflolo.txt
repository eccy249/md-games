I have a five level demo available. Its yet completly silent. I would really like to see some feedback as to if 
you understand what to do in this game, without instructions. How far can you get in my demo, if the only thing 
I tell you is that you have to collect all the hearts, the Treasure and then head for exit?

Is it fun?

**********************************************************

The project is in danger of not being continued though.
I Had a vision when I started this project to port Amiga games to Genesis because most people have enough time to 
start a Genesis emulator but fewer have the time to setup an Amiga emulator.

Because if you live in a normal boring town with a mortage and cannot quit your daily job to make games, how do you 
get people to play your hobby game, when there are so many good hobby projects theese days?

Making a new game takes so much time and is so hard that its hardly a hobby. In order for it to be good you have to 
put together graphics and art and stuff, so therefore my hobby was bound to be to an old console. This also solves 
the compatibility problem, as a Genesis emulator is something that most system have.

But no kid will ever play any game made here, only other 35-year old nerds. I therefore started to think about how 
to get another 35-year old nerd to play my hobby project. Giving them away for free is not enough, because they 
mostly play old games for nostalgic reasons and there are 10000 free games with a classic touch. I therefore thought 
that I if I started to port old amiga games that theese people recognised, then maybe a few would play my games. 
(My first game is an old nes game, hope this doesnt confuse you :), cause it was a good game to start with) Sure 
there are a few collectors that might buy a new genesis game but they are really few and might not even play it.

I was planning to just release the rom on the Internet and se it pop ut from place to place. However having googled 
for copyright laws, I now see that I can get sued even if its a dead console, and even if its given away for free 
as a hobby project. In order for me to continue, I HAVE TO SOLVE THE LEGAL ISSUES. I have two kids, and the should 
not grow up poor because their father have a nerdy hobby. I can change the character name to Lollo from lolo and so
on, but then I like totally miss my audience.

The same goes for all other planned games. I have known this for some time, but I thought a at least should release 
the Demo and see if anyone have any great ideas how to solve this.

I really thought I should get away with the game beeing free and not have to think about legal issues.
