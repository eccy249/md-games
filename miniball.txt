Miniball SE for Sega Megadrive/Genesis

This game is FREEWARE. You can use and copy it as much
as you like as long as you do not modify any of the game
files.

This is a game similar to "Breakout" or "Arkanoid",
with the difference that in this game you have four
pads (instead of just one) - one pad on each side of
the screen - and you have to catch the ball on all 
sides of the screen.

A Java version of this game (which is playable in your 
web browser) is available on my website (see above).
