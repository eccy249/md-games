Battle City for SEGA MEgaDrive2
«: July 12, 2009, 17:35:10»

I decided to engage in a dense port of tanks for sega, one of the priorities is the maximum resemblance to the original. 
Already something is ready and even there are several levels on which it is possible to crush opponents.

In the course of the promotion of the work I will spread in this thread new versions in the flesh to the final. 
while I spread beta1.0. Enjoy! (:
